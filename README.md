# Advent of Code, Year Three - ECMAScript 6 Solutions (with Node.js)

Third time around Iâ€™m doing the wonderful problems provided by Eric Wastl on his [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) website. My goal for the [first year](https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code-ruby) was putting all the basic CS knowledge (data structures, algorithms) I was learning into action with a language I was very comfortable with (Ruby). My goal during the [second year](https://github.com/wmleidy/advent-of-code2-coffee) was to deepen my knowledge of CoffeeScript, which I use quite frequently in my job. While 98% of the JavaScript I write is still in CoffeeScript, sooner or later ECMAScript 6 will become something that I program in on a daily basis, so my goal for this year is to take some solid steps to learning idiomatically ES6 (and have fun too, of course).

Just as with the previous two years, on particularly interesting days, I check the solution megathread in the [AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) after completing the problem and will occasionally include these findings at the bottom of my files.
